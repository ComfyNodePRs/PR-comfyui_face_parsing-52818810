This is a set of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). 
The nodes utilize the [face parsing model](https://huggingface.co/jonathandinu/face-parsing) to provide detailed segmantation of face. To improve face segmantation accuracy, [yolov8 face model](https://huggingface.co/Bingsu/adetailer/) is used to first extract face from an image.
